## Abstract

util-linux is a standard package distributed by the Linux Kernel Organization for use as part of the Linux operating system. A fork, util-linux-ng (with ng meaning "next generation"), was created when development stalled, but as of January 2011 has been renamed back to util-linux, and is the official version of the package.
